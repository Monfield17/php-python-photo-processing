# PHP + Python – Example of Image Processing Integration

This project demonstrates a simple integration between a PHP application and an external Python script.  
It is designed as a small technical showcase of:

- batch-style image processing in PHP (`PhotoBatchProcessor`)
- calling a Python script from PHP (`PhotoAiRunner`)
- a minimal AI-like JSON output from Python (`analyze.py`)
- a simple test runner (`test.php`)

The goal of this repository is to present clean code structure, cross‑language integration, and basic data processing logic.
